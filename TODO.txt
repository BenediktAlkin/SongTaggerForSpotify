tutorial
- login
- tag songs
- generate 

minor bugs:
- graph editor: nodes attach to mouse if mouse is released over e.g. a textbox while dragging a node
- playlists binding error in tageditor (not initially but after sync)
- newtag datacontext bugs sometimes (validator not working; NewTagText set null but not updated in ui) --> ugly workaround was implemented


future
- search function (search for track and tag it)
- audio features viewer/filter
- top tracks
- check if everything that is cancelable has cancellationtokens
- settings for treeview expansions
