test db path change
check what errors are thrown when api and sst are open and dbfile is moved

code improvements:
- DatabaseOperations should take Id/Name as parameters instead of the whole object when the whole object is not used (e.g. for edit/delete)
- Dialogs should be templated
- the SpotifyPlayer control ViewModel should be seperate
- viewmodel tests
- DatabaseOperationsTests should probably use DatabaseOperations to prepare tests instead of directly inserting into db

minor bugs:
- graph editor: nodes attach to mouse if mouse is released over e.g. a textbox while dragging a node
- playlists binding error in tageditor (not initially but after sync)
- newtag datacontext bugs sometimes (validator not working; NewTagText set null but not updated in ui) --> ugly workaround was implemented
- IsRunning does not belong into GraphGeneratorPage (should be in a seperate viewmodel)
- set progress/volume fires twice (when not dragged)
- RemoveNode had strange case where output result of input nodes was null that could not be reproduced
- RemoveNode had strange case where upon deleting input the input node would still be displayed as input (not sure if it was stored in db also)
- DatabaseOperations inserts with duplicate id throw exception (wrap with try catch)

future
- change path to db file
- search function (search for track and tag it)
- audio features viewer/filter
- top tracks
- settings for treeview expansions
- import/export (current version has some bugs: sometimes it crashes the app; calling db.SaveChanges() after export deleted all artist/tag associations)
