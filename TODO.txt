errors during tagging probbly occour when connection is used too long and therefore times out
notice somehow if token gets invalid
check if all spotify operations return empty results that do not lead to crashes

minor bugs:
- graph editor: nodes attach to mouse if mouse is released over e.g. a textbox while dragging a node
- playlists binding error in tageditor (not initially but after sync)


future
- search function (search for track and tag it)
- audio features viewer/filter
- top tracks
- check if everything that is cancelable has cancellationtokens
- settings for treeview expansions
