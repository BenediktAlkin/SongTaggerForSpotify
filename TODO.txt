more nodes (year filter node, ...)
improve node view

errors during tagging probbly occour when connection is used too long and therefore times out
notice somehow if token gets invalid
check if all spotify operations return empty results that do not lead to crashes

installer does not provide access to the folders
check if the Resource blocks at the start of views are needed

minor bugs:
- graph editor: nodes attach to mouse if mouse is released over e.g. a textbox while dragging a node


future
- search function (search for track and tag it)
- audio features viewer/filter
- top tracks
