I made a Song Tagger for Spotify to help organize your Spotify music library


TLDR: I made an app for tagging songs in your Spotify library. You can get it [here](https://github.com/BenediktAlkin/SongTaggerForSpotify/releases/latest). [Here](https://youtu.be/TM9wBnZ6so4) is a video showcasing the app.


# What is song tagging?
Song tagging allows you to add additional information to a song in the form of some text. This can be anything you'd like (e.g. music genre, language, where you got to know this song from, ...).

For example it could look like [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenediktAlkin/SongTaggerForSpotify/main/Examples/QuotaExtensionApplication/SongTagger.png).


# Why would I do this?
Song Tagger for Spotify allows you to create playlists based on these tags. This makes it easy to organize your whole library. For example you can [easily make genre specific playlists](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenediktAlkin/SongTaggerForSpotify/main/Examples/QuotaExtensionApplication/PlaylistGenerator_genres.png) where you don't have to manually update them when you find new music you like.


# What else is there?
Song Tagger for Spotify allows you to create "Playlist Generators", which allows you to easily manipulate your Spotify library into new playlists.
For example you can:

* Create your own [decade-specifig playlists](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenediktAlkin/SongTaggerForSpotify/main/Examples/90s.png)
* Create your [own version of a public playlist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenediktAlkin/SongTaggerForSpotify/main/Examples/alter%20public%20playlist.png) that updates when the original playlist is updated ("Party" is a public playlist that I do not have editing rights on and is regularly updated with new music; "overplayed" is a tag I assigned to songs that I have heard a lot and don't want in my version of the playlist)
* Simplify your routine for discovering new music
  * Combine your ["Disocver Weekly" and "Release Radar" playlists into one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenediktAlkin/SongTaggerForSpotify/main/Examples/combine%20discover.png) (and filter out music you already know)
  * Combine [charts from multiple countries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenediktAlkin/SongTaggerForSpotify/main/Examples/combine%20charts.png) (and filter music you already know)
